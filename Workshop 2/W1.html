From being in the company and working with Peterson, he started learning multiple business ideas. When the company was struggling to move forward, Watson was assigned to run the business. As expected, he knocked his business competitor and his business started flourishing.<br>After working at NCR for years he joined another company which was called Computing Tabulating Recording Company, famous for its electrical punch cards systems. After working for few years he became the general manager of that company. Later that company grew into what we know today as International Business Company. His tabulating machines made upto 90% in the market in US. With the domination of the market with his products, he wanted to internationally extend his business. Even during the World War he was able to connect his business internationally and maintain foreign relations. A keynote during his international business meeting "World peace through world trade" becama a motto of IBM. He was also known as US President Franklin D.
